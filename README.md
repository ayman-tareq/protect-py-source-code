PyEncoder is a Python script that allows you to protect and make your Python source code unreadable. It uses a combination of base64, zlib, and marshal techniques to obfuscate your code, making it more challenging for others to read or reverse engineer. By using PyEncoder, you can add an extra layer of security to your Python projects and safeguard your intellectual property.
